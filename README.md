## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In this regression model, the vehicle length and ground clearance had a significant effect on miles per gallon.  The p-values for each variable were well below .001, meaning it could be said with 99.99% certainty that these variables did not randomly contribute to the variance seen in miles per gallon.  Due to the significant relationships found in this model, it would not be accurate to say that the slopes of the regression lines are zero.  If no linear relationships existed, then the slopes could be considered zero.  This model does not predit miles per gallon very accurately.  The adjusted R-squared value is 0.6825, meaning this model accounts for 68.25% of the variance seen in miles per gallon.  There may be other variables to explore, such as engine size, exhaust type, or number of car body vents.
